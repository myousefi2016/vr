|-
|'''Input''' (Input)
|
This property specifies the input dataset to be used by
the contour filter.
|

|
Accepts input of following types:
* vtkImageData
The dataset must contain a field array (point)

with 1 component(s).

|-
|'''Contour By''' (SelectInputScalars)
|
This property specifies the name of the scalar array
from which the contour filter will compute isolines and/or
isosurfaces.
|

|
An array of scalars is required.The value must be field array name.
|-
|'''Isosurfaces''' (ContourValues)
|
This property specifies the values at which to compute
isosurfaces/isolines and also the number of such
values.
|

|
The value must lie within the range of the selected data array.

==Flying Edges 3D==

Generates isosurfaces from 3D image data (volume).
Generates an isosurface from 3D image data (volume). It
implements the algorithm in: Flying Edges: A High-Performance
Scalable Isocontouring Algorithm by Schroeder, Maynard,
Geveci.

|

|
An array of scalars is required.The value must be field array name.
|-
|'''ComputeNormals''' (ComputeNormals)
|
If this property is set to 1, a scalar array containing
a normal value at each point in the isosurface or isoline will be
created by the contour filter; otherwise an array of normals will not
be computed. This operation is fairly expensive both in terms of
computation time and memory required, so if the output dataset produced
by the contour filter will be processed by filters that modify the
dataset's topology or geometry, it may be wise to set the value of this
property to 0. Select whether to compute normals.
|
1
|
Accepts boolean values (0 or 1).
|-
|'''ComputeGradients''' (ComputeGradients)
|
If this property is set to 1, a scalar array containing
a gradient value at each point in the isosurface or isoline will be
created by this filter; otherwise an array of gradients will not be
computed. This operation is fairly expensive both in terms of
computation time and memory required, so if the output dataset produced
by the contour filter will be processed by filters that modify the
dataset's topology or geometry, it may be wise to set the value of this
property to 0. Not that if ComputeNormals is set to 1, then gradients
will have to be calculated, but they will only be stored in the output
dataset if ComputeGradients is also set to 1.
|
0
|
Accepts boolean values (0 or 1).
|-
|'''ComputeScalars''' (ComputeScalars)
|
If this property is set to 1, an array of scalars
(containing the contour value) will be added to the output dataset. If
set to 0, the output will not contain this array.
|
0
|
Accepts boolean values (0 or 1).
|-
|'''Isosurfaces''' (ContourValues)
|
This property specifies the values at which to compute
isosurfaces/isolines and also the number of such
values.
|

|
The value must lie within the range of the selected data array.

==Flying Edges Plane Cutter==

Cut a volume with a plane and generates a polygonal cut surface
Flying Edges Plane Cutter is a specialization of the
FlyingEdges algorithm to cut a volume with a single plane. It
is designed for performance and an exploratory, fast workflow.

|-
|'''Slice Type''' (Plane)
|
This property sets the parameters of the slice
function.
