==Fast-Marching Geodesic Distance-Field From Binary Field==

Compute the distance of points of the mesh to chosen seeds
Compute the distance of each point of the mesh to a set of seeds
defined as points with non-zero value. Internal Fast-Marching-Method
plugin is used for computational efficiency.

|'''Seeds Non-Zero Field''' (SeedsNonZeroField)
|

Select the input array to be treated as defining seeds.
A point having a non-zero value will be considered as being a seed.

|
0
|
An array of scalars is required.The value must be field array name.
|-
|'''IsotropicMetricTensorLength''' (IsotropicMetricTensorLength)
|
Select the input array to be treated as the Metric
Tensor.It can only be an isometric tensor, and the selected field should
contain the length of the metric tensor at each polydata point.

Accepts input of following types:
* vtkPointSet
|-
|'''Create Loop''' (Loop)
|

If on, enables loop creation by computing a path from the
last point to first point in the endpoints.

|
0
|
Accepts boolean values (0 or 1).
|-
|'''Create Loop with Line''' (LoopWithLine)
|

If on and if Create Loop is on, uses a straight line segment
to connect the last point to the first point in the endpoints.

|
0
|
Accepts boolean values (0 or 1).
