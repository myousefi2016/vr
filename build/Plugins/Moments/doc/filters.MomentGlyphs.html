        Circulation is a vector field on 1D cells that represents flow
        along the path of the cell.  Flux is a vector field on 2D cells
        that represents flow through the area of the cell.  This filter
        creates arrow glyphs in the direction of the flow.  The array
        values associated with the 2D and 1D geometric elements will be
        converted to a vector pointing in the direction of the flow.

          The name of the scalar or vector array that represents flux
          through a 2D element or circulation along a 1D element.  If
          necessary, this array will be converted to a vector pointing in
          the direction the flow or circulation is moving.
