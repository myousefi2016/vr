==Moment Glyphs==

Create glyphs pointing in the direction of flux or circulation.
Circulation is a vector field on 1D cells that represents flow
along the path of the cell. Flux is a vector field on 2D cells
that represents flow through the area of the cell. This filter
creates arrow glyphs in the direction of the flow. The array
values associated with the 2D and 1D geometric elements will be
converted to a vector pointing in the direction of the flow.

|-
|'''Input''' (Input)
|

The input to the filter.

|

|
Accepts input of following types:
* vtkDataSet
The dataset must contain a field array (cell)

|-
|'''Flux/Circulation Array''' (SelectInputScalars)
|

The name of the scalar or vector array that represents flux
through a 2D element or circulation along a 1D element. If
necessary, this array will be converted to a vector pointing in
the direction the flow or circulation is moving.

|

|
An array of scalars is required.The value must be field array name.
|-
|'''Input Moment Is Density''' (InputMomentIsDensity)
|

If off, then the input array is taken to be the total flux
through or circulation along each element. If on, then the input
array is taken to be the density of the flux or circulation.

|
0
|
Accepts boolean values (0 or 1).
|-
|'''Scale By Density''' (ScaleByDenisty)
|

If off, then the glyphs are scaled by the total flux through or
circulation along each element. If on, then the glyphs are
scaled by the flux or circulation density.

|
0
|
Accepts boolean values (0 or 1).

==Moment Vectors==

Convert scalars to flux or circulation vectors.
Often times a simulation that computes circulation or flux in a
mesh will simply write out the scalar that represents the amount of
movement and the direction is implied by the normal of the surface
cell (for flux) or the direction of the line cell (for
circulation). The array values associated with the 2D and 1D
geometric elements will be converted to a vector pointing in the
direction of the flow.
