==Plane Glyphs==

Create evenly spaced glyphs on the plane.
This filter probes a volume with regularly spaced samples on a
plane and generates oriented glyphs. It also supports some special
scaling of the glyphs to look nice on electric field data.

|

The input of this filter simply provides the bounds that will be used
to set the size of the plane.

Accepts input of following types:
* vtkDataSet
|-
|'''Center''' (Center)
|

The center of the geometry created.

|
0.0 0.0 0.0

The value must lie within the bounding box of the dataset.

It will default to the mid in each dimension.

|'''Normal''' (Normal)
|

The normal to the plane.

|-
|'''Resolution''' (Resolution)
|

The number of probe samples to have in each direction.
