        This uses a spatial search object to quickly locate points
        in 3D.  This locator works by dividing a specified region of
        space into a regular array of cuboid buckets, and then keeping a
        list of points that lie in each bucket. Typical operation involves giving
        a position in 3D and finding the closest point; or finding the N closest
        points.
<p>
        This locator is an accelerated version of a point locator. It is
        threaded (via vtkSMPTools), and supports one-time static construction
        (i.e., incremental point insertion is not supported).
