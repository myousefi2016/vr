                     The Particle Trace filter generates pathlines in a vector
                     field from a collection of seed points. The vector field
                     used is selected from the Vectors menu, so the input data
                     set is required to have point-centered vectors. The Seed
                     portion of the interface allows you to select whether the
                     seed points for this integration lie in a point cloud or
                     along a line. Depending on which is selected, the
                     appropriate 3D widget (point or line widget) is displayed
                     along with traditional user interface controls for
                     positioning the point cloud or line within the data set.
                     Instructions for using the 3D widgets and the
                     corresponding manual controls can be found in section 7.4.
                     This filter operates on any type of data set, provided it
                     has point-centered vectors. The output is polygonal data
                     containing polylines. This filter is available on the
                     Toolbar.</div>
